### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Robert and I have been coding since I don't know when. I guess I started around 1988-1990 on my Amiga 500.
The best days ever.

 - Working on the codebase @ Quantum Gateway Solutions in go, javascript/typescript.
 - Learning to master neovim and the flamenco guitar.
 - Ask me about the quantum gateway foundation and what we do.
