### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Robert and I have been coding since too long, but somewhere between late 1980s early 1990s on my Amiga 500.
The best coding days ever, but now I have kids of my own which are the best all over again!

Currently I am :
 - Working on the codebase @ Quantum Gateway Solutions in go, javascript/typescript using lots of docker functionalities.
 - Learning to master neovim and the flamenco guitar.
 - Ask me about the quantum gateway foundation and what we do.
